## 🎯 Learning Patterns

This repository focuses on mastering these common problem-solving patterns:

- **Two Pointers**: Problems involving array/list traversal from both ends
- **Sliding Window**: Fixed or variable window problems
- **Fast & Slow Pointers**: Cycle detection, middle element
- **Merge Intervals**: Overlapping intervals problems
- **Cyclic Sort**: Problems on arrays with numbers in a given range
- **In-place Reversal**: Reversing linked lists
- **Tree BFS**: Level-order traversal problems
- **Tree DFS**: Pre-order, in-order, post-order traversals
- **Two Heaps**: Median finding, scheduling problems
- **Subsets**: Combinations and permutations
- **Modified Binary Search**: Search in rotated/modified arrays
- **Top K Elements**: Finding K largest/smallest elements
- **K-way Merge**: Merging K sorted lists

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd dsa-practice
