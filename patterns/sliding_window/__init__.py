Sliding Window pattern problems.

Pattern: Maintain a window that slides through array/string.
Time: Usually O(n)
Space: O(1) to O(n) depending on requirements

Identify the pattern:
- Given an array/string
- Find the maximum/minimum sum/length of a subarray/substring of window size k
- Window size can be fixed(given) or variable(find the window size)

Common use cases:
- Contiguous subarray problems
- Maximum/minimum sum of size k
- Longest substring with k distinct characters
- String anagrams
